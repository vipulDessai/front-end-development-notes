# CSS

- CSS specificity and the cascade
- Layouts with flex, grid, and positioning tricks
- Responsive design without 40 media queries
- Animations that don’t fry your GPU (helloo vertex shaders..)

# JS

- Prototypal inheritance
- Closures, scopes, hoisting
- Execution context + call stack
- Event delegation and bubbling
- Async/await, promises, and maybe callbacks
- Memory management and garbage collection
- Functional programming stuff like pure functions and immutability
- And of course... TypeScript’s delightful generics, unions, intersections, and mapped types

# React

- How virtual DOM & reconciliation works
- Lifecycle methods (class vs hooks)
- Controlled/uncontrolled inputs
- React Query / SWR for data fetching
- Context, custom hooks, error boundaries
- Render optimization techniques (memoization, lazy evaluation)
- State management with Redux, Zustand, Jotai or whatever is cool this week
- And don’t forget Next.js, Remix, or maybe go full server components

# Performance

- Just lazy load everything.
- Split your bundles.
- Shake your trees.
- Analyze your core web vitals.

# Security

- XSS
- CSRF
- Storage attacks
- CORS headaches
- And sanitize every user input ever

# Others

- Accessibility??
- Internationalization
- Test everything (unit, integration, E2E)
- Make it work on Safari. On an iPhone. In landscape mode. With no network.
